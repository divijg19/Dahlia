This plan assumes we are building a system that serves a user-facing application, such as a social media platform, a data analysis tool, or an e-commerce site.
In my case, it's all.

# Architecture Plan: The Hybrid Polyglot Web Service

This architecture is designed to maximize performance by leveraging the strengths of each language. Go acts as a smart, high-performance gateway and a standalone server for simple requests. Rust and Python function as internal, specialized "accelerators" for tasks that Go is less suited for.

### Core Principles

1.  **Single Point of Entry:** All external client traffic (web, mobile) communicates **only** with the Go service. The Rust and Python services are never exposed to the public internet.
2.  **Go as the Orchestrator:** The Go service is the brain. It understands the incoming requests and decides whether to handle them itself or to delegate work to one or more downstream services.
3.  **Stateless Internal Services:** The Rust and Python services should be designed to be stateless. They receive data, perform a task, and return a result. All state is managed by Go or in a shared database/cache.
4.  **High-Speed Internal Communication:** Communication between services must be extremely fast. We will use gRPC with Protocol Buffers for this, as it is much faster and more robust than REST/JSON for internal traffic.

### I. Component Roles & Responsibilities

#### 1. Go Service (The Gateway)
-   **Public Interface:** Exposes a REST or GraphQL API to the outside world over HTTP/S.
-   **Core Logic:**
    -   Handles user authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT validation).
    -   Performs rate limiting and request validation.
    -   Manages all simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Any request that is a straightforward database or cache lookup should be handled **entirely within the Go service**.
-   **Orchestration:**
    -   For complex requests, it calls the Rust and/or Python services via gRPC.
    -   It aggregates the responses from these services, formats a final response, and sends it back to the client.
-   **Primary Data Access:** It is the only service that should directly communicate with the primary database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and the cache (e.g., Redis).

#### 2. Rust Service (The Engine)
-   **Interface:** Exposes an internal gRPC server. It does not have an HTTP server.
-   **Responsibilities:** Provides pure, high-performance functions for CPU-bound tasks.
    -   Example gRPC endpoint: `rpc GenerateAnalyticsReport(ReportRequest) returns (ReportResponse) {}`
    -   Example gRPC endpoint: `rpc ResizeImage(ImageRequest) returns (ImageResponse) {}`
-   **Characteristics:** Stateless, horizontally scalable. You can run many instances of this service if a particular computation becomes a bottleneck.

#### 3. Python Service (The AI/ML Brain)
-   **Interface:** Exposes an internal gRPC server.
-   **Responsibilities:** Handles all tasks that benefit from Python's rich data science and machine learning ecosystem.
    -   Loads pre-trained models into memory on startup for fast inference.
    -   Example gRPC endpoint: `rpc GetRecommendations(UserRequest) returns (RecommendationResponse) {}`
    -   Example gRPC endpoint: `rpc AnalyzeSentiment(TextRequest) returns (SentimentResponse) {}`
-   **Characteristics:** Can be stateful in memory (e.g., holding large models) but should not manage persistent user state. Also horizontally scalable.

### II. Communication Protocol: gRPC & Protocol Buffers

To define the contracts between your services, you will create a central repository for your `.proto` files.

**Example `definitions.proto`:**

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package services;

// Service provided by the Rust Engine
service ComputeEngine {
  // Performs a heavy calculation on a set of numbers
  rpc PerformCalculation(CalculationRequest) returns (CalculationResponse);
}

message CalculationRequest {
  repeated double numbers = 1;
  string operation = 2;
}

message CalculationResponse {
  double result = 1;
}

// Service provided by the Python Brain
service AIBrain {
  // Gets personalized recommendations for a user
  rpc GetRecommendations(RecommendationRequest) returns (RecommendationResponse);
}

message RecommendationRequest {
  int32 user_id = 1;
  int32 result_count = 2;
}

message RecommendationResponse {
  repeated int32 item_ids = 1;
}
```

This file becomes the source of truth. You will use it to auto-generate the client code in Go and the server stubs in Rust and Python.

### III. Request Flow Walkthroughs

#### Scenario A: Simple Request (Handled by Go)

*   **Request:** `GET /api/v1/users/me`
1.  A client sends the request with an auth token.
2.  The **Go Service** receives the HTTP request.
3.  The Go auth middleware validates the JWT token.
4.  The handler extracts the `user_id` from the token.
5.  The Go service queries its in-memory cache or Redis for the user's data.
6.  If not in cache, it queries the PostgreSQL database.
7.  The Go service marshals the user data to JSON and sends the HTTP response.
8.  **Result:** Fast, low-latency response. The Rust and Python services are idle and consume no resources for this request.

#### Scenario B: Complex Request (Orchestrated by Go)

*   **Request:** `POST /api/v1/generate-personalized-report`
1.  A client sends the request.
2.  The **Go Service** receives the HTTP request and validates the user's session.
3.  The Go service recognizes this is a complex task. It acts as an orchestrator:
    a.  It first makes a gRPC call to the **Python Service**: `GetRecommendations(user_id)`.
    b.  The Python service runs its ML model and returns a list of recommended item IDs.
    c.  The Go service then fetches data for these items from the database.
    d.  It bundles this data into a new request and makes a gRPC call to the **Rust Service**: `PerformCalculation(report_data)`.
    e.  The Rust service performs heavy statistical analysis on the data and returns a computed result.
4.  The Go service aggregates the data from both calls, formats the final JSON report, and sends the HTTP response to the client.
5.  **Result:** A powerful feature is delivered that would be inefficient to build in a single language, with each component performing at its peak.

### IV. Deployment & Infrastructure

1.  **Containerization:** Each service (Go, Rust, Python) will have its own `Dockerfile`.
2.  **Local Development:** Use `docker-compose.yml` to define and run the entire stack (all three services, plus Postgres and Redis) with a single command.
3.  **Networking:** The services will communicate over a private Docker network. Only the Go service will expose a port (e.g., `8080`) to the host machine. The gRPC services will run on internal ports that are not publicly accessible.
4.  **Configuration:** Manage configuration (database URLs, service addresses) through environment variables injected into the containers.

### V. Key Considerations for Success

-   **Observability is Crucial:**
    -   **Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) in all three services.
    -   **Distributed Tracing:** Use a library like OpenTelemetry. The Go service should generate a `trace_id` for each incoming request and pass it along in the metadata of its gRPC calls to Rust and Python. This allows you to trace a single request's journey across the entire system, which is invaluable for debugging.
-   **Error Handling:** The Go service must be resilient to failures in downstream services. If the Python service is down, can the Go service return a partial response or a sensible fallback? Implement patterns like retries and circuit breakers.
-   **Shared Code:** The compiled Protocol Buffer definitions will be the only "code" shared between the services. This creates a clean, well-defined boundary.
